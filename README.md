# Tutorial for Using EditiX to Analyze and Translate CGMES XML
CGMES XML translation to OpenIPSL using XSLT is beneficial because it allows extended dynamic analysis of power systems. Many models are created and maintained in PSSÂ®E which doesn't provide multi-domain modeling like OpenIPSL. This tool allows you to learn how to translate. Please see the [Documentation](https://alsetlab.github.io/XSLTConferencePaper/tutorials.html).

[Editix](https://www.editix.com/) is an interactive development environment for XML/XSLT.

This tutorial will use the features of EditiX to analyze CGMES XML and located the parameters necessary to load into OpenIPSL. While editing XML, it also allows quick and clear separation of components into files that show up as tabs.
