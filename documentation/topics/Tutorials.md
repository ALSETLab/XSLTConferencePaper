## Requirements
Editix is an interactive development environment for XML/XSLT:
[https://www.editix.com/](https://www.editix.com/)

Version 2023 - Build 010123 is used, it can be downloaded [here](https://www.editix.com/#download) and used free-of-charge for 30 days.

This tutorial will use the features of EditiX to analyze CGMES XML and lcoated the parameters necessary to load into OpenIPSL. While editing XML, it also allows quick and clear separation of components into files that show up as tabs.
