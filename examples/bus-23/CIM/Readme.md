The name of the package is derived from the &lt;md:FullModel&gt; node. Since it can not start with a number, this CIM has been modified to start with a letter.

Also, multiple declarations of 'West' were found in the errors for Modelica. This indicates that each &lt;ConnectivityNode&gt; is not unique. Therefore it was modified to make the two 'West' values into 'West1' and 'West2'.
